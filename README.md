# Overview
This is a baking site was made for a person who was looking into peotentialy getting into the online realm of sellling her products in an online fassion. She needed a way other than word of mouth and through her where her content could be see, have some background information, and basic information abut her products. That is where the creation of this site comes in. All information, and images where given to me from the client. And all content was approved by her. Some of the creation was a culmination of both her vision, and my understanding and knowledge of site creation.

# Main Content

### Home
The Home page is made up of a simple introduction. It includes three images of products she has available to make (that she has made), a title, and a review she chose. The images rotate randomly avery 30 seconds. This was done using JavaScript to rotate through a JSON file that consists of the title, image and review.

### About Me
The abot me page conists two breife stories of how she got to where she is now. It was meant to be consise and to the point, while still drawing the customer in.

### Contact
The contact page is meant to be a page where anyone can contact her about anything they may want. It uses an HTML form that is linked to an email using a third party service called [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). I choes this because it allowed for a more safe, and smeamless trasition of information. It also allowed for the addition of captia to avoid having to deal with bots. The form was designed to be simple, easy to read, and clear to the user what is requiered and what is not. JavaScriptn is used on the "Contact" button to submit the form, which will send all ifromation to the clients email, in a clear and simple way to read.

### Order
The order page has two differnt parts. The first protion displayes the menue in a simple and easy to read format. The client wanted to add a bassic, but neat image of a oder sign. It also has a banner that the user close with the lates product the client has come out with.

The second portion consits of an order contents, that has a lits of everything the user can oder. It uses a number input to allow the user to input a number or use the up and down arrows to change the number. The information portion is simmilar to the contact, where it will take the users needed inforation to reach out to them for payment. The client only dealt in cash, so no pay portal was needed. The date wanted uses JavaScript to not allow the user to select a date that is one week before the date that is cutrent. So for example, if the user orders on the first, the soonest they can request the order is seventh. This gave the client ample time to get what they need. The submission is sent the same as the contact page.

The header grafic was created using free tools in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and was used to match the colors of the page. The colors of the page were created using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). All coolors were checked using [Contrast Ratio](https://www.siegemedia.com/contrast-ratio?ref=frontendchecklist) a free tool that tells you what level your colors pass with whenm it comes to crtrast and accessabilty.

### Navigation

The navigation uses JavaScript to add an emogy to each tab you are on to allow the user an easy way to see what page they are on. It also utilizes a menu button when in mobile view, that is a more user frienbdly model in that view. It uses JavaScript and a button to allow the user to open and close it.

### Footer
