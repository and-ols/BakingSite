# Overview
This is a baking site was made for a person who was looking into peotentialy getting into the online realm of sellling her products in an online fassion. She needed a way other than word of mouth and through her where her content could be see, have some background information, and basic information abut her products. That is where the creation of this site comes in. All information, and images where given to me from the client. And all content was approved by her. Some of the creation was a culmination of both her vision, and my understanding and knowledge of site creation.

### Home
The Home page is made up of a simple introduction. It includes three images of products she has available to make (that she has made), a title, and a review she chose. The images rotate randomly avery 30 seconds. This was done using JavaScript to rotate through a JSON file that consists of the title, image and review.

### Contact
The contact page is meant to be a page where anyone can contact her about anything they may want. It uses an HTML form that is linked to an email using a third party service called Formspree. I choes this because it allowed for a more safe, and smeamless trasition of information. It also allowed for the addition of captia to avoid having to deal with bots. The form was designed to be simple, easy to read, and clear to the user what is requiered and what is not. JavaScriptn is used on the "Contact" button to submit the form, which will send all ifromation to the clients email, in a clear and simple way to read.
