# Overview
This is a baking site was made for a person who was looking into potential getting into the online realm of selling her products in an online fashion. She needed a way other than word of mouth and through her where her content could be seen, to have some background information, and basic information about her products. That is where the creation of this site came in. All information and images were given to me by the client. And all content was approved by her. Some of the creations were a culmination of both her vision, and my understanding and knowledge of site creation.

# Main Content


### Home

The Home page is made up of a simple introduction. It includes three images of products she has available to make (that she has made), a title, and a review she chose. The images rotate randomly every 30 seconds. This was done using JavaScript to rotate through a JSON file that consists of the title, image and review.


### About Me

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85de5b24-92c7-48a1-937b-de6e8de72feb)

The about me page consists of two brief stories of how she got to where she is now. It was meant to be concise and to the point, while still drawing the customer in.

### Contact

The contact page is meant to be a page where anyone can contact her about anything they may want. It uses an HTML form that is linked to an email using a third-party service called [Formspree](https://formspree.io/). I chose this because it allowed for a safer, and seamless transition of information. It also allowed for the addition of captcha to avoid having to deal with bots. The form was designed to be simple, easy to read, and clear to the user what is required and what is not. JavaScript is used on the "Contact" button to submit the form, which will send all information to the clientâ€™s email, in a clear and simple way to read.

### Order

The order page has two different parts. The first portion displays the menu in a simple and easy to read format. The client wanted to add a basic, but neat image of an order sign. It also has a banner that the user closes with the lates product the client has come out with.

The second portion consists of an order contents, that has a list of everything the user can order. It uses a number input to allow the user to input a number or use the up and down arrows to change the number. The information portion is like the contact, where it will take the users needed information to reach out to them for payment. The client only dealt in cash, so no pay portal was needed. The date wanted uses JavaScript to not allow the user to select a date that is one week before the date that is current. So, for example, if the user orders on the first, the soonest they can request the order is seventh. This gave the client ample time to get what they need. The submission is sent the same as the contact page.


# Header, Navigation and Footer

### Header

The header graphic was created using free tools in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and was used to match the colors of the page. The colors of the page were created using [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). All colors were checked using [Contrast Ratio](https://www.siegemedia.com/contrast-ratio?ref=frontendchecklist) a free tool that tells you what level your colors pass with when it comes to contrast and accessibility.


### Navigation

The navigation uses JavaScript to add an emoji to each tab you are on to allow the user an easy way to see what page they are on. It also utilizes a menu button when in mobile view, that is a more user-friendly model in that view. It uses JavaScript and a button to allow the user to open and close it.

### Footer
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6cf16b9-0d75-4e56-b91f-667fd6f78b48)

The footer consists of contact information, and a link to her Facebook in the form of an icon.
